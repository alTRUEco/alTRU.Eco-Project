## Sustainability priorities

We are developing a Toolkit for _**De**centralized **F**ederated **Co**llaborative **E**conomy_

**[The eBay of altruism](https://github.com/DeCentral-Budapest/altruist-platform-meteor)**

A Trusted _F/LOSS_ marketplace for **collaborative economy**, where individuals, communities and organizations able to share their **resources**, **services** and **needs** in a trusted way for money, in exchange for other goods and services, or like a give away, for free.

_\> We are provided with **times of abundance** which enables us to **share with others**._
